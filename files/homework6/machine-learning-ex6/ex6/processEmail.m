% Load Vocabulary

% ========================== Preprocess Email ===========================

% Find the Headers ( \n\n and remove )
% Uncomment the following lines if you are working with raw emails with the
% full headers

% char(10) is the ASCII code for the new line
% hdrstart will be a vector containing the indexes of each occurence of \n\n
hdrstart = strfind(email_contents, ([char(10) char(10)]));
email_contents = email_contents(hdrstart(1):end);

% Lower case
email_contents = lower(email_contents);

% Strip all HTML
% Looks for any expression that starts with < and ends with > and replace
% and does not have any < or > in the tag it with a space
email_contents = regexprep(email_contents, '<[^<>]+>', ' ');

% Handle Numbers
% Look for one or more characters between 0-9
% regexprep is a find & replace function; 1st argument: the string in which we
% search; 2nd argument: sought text (to be replaced); 3rd argument: text with
% which we replace the text at the 2nd argument
email_contents = regexprep(email_contents, '[0-9]+', 'number');

% Handle URLS
% Look for strings starting with http:// or https://
email_contents = regexprep(email_contents, ...
                           '(http|https)://[^\s]*', 'httpaddr');

% Handle Email Addresses
% Look for strings with @ in the middle
email_contents = regexprep(email_contents, '[^\s]+@[^\s]+', 'emailaddr');

% Handle $ sign
email_contents = regexprep(email_contents, '[$]+', 'dollar');


% ========================== Tokenize Email ===========================

% Output the email to screen as well
fprintf('\n==== Processed Email ====\n\n');

% Process file
l = 0;

while ~isempty(email_contents)

    % Tokenize and also get rid of any punctuation
    % we go through email_contents until we encounter one of the characters in
    % the cell array provided as parameter to strtok; when such a character is
    % encountered, we obtain str - the components in email_contents until such
    % a character is encountered, and email_contents is updated to include the
    % remainder of the elements, starting with the special character encountered 
    [str, email_contents] = ...
       strtok(email_contents, ...
              [' @$/#.-:&*+=[]?!(){},''">_<;%' char(10) char(13)]);
   
    % Remove any non alphanumeric characters
    str = regexprep(str, '[^a-zA-Z0-9]', '');

    % Stem the word 
    % (the porterStemmer sometimes has issues, so we use a try catch block)
    try str = porterStemmer(strtrim(str)); 
    catch str = ''; continue;
    end;

    % Skip the word if it is too short
    if length(str) < 1
       continue;
    end

    % Look up the word in the dictionary and add to word_indices if
    % found
    % ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
    % Instructions: Fill in this function to add the index of str to
    %               word_indices if it is in the vocabulary. At this point
    %               of the code, you have a stemmed word from the email in
    %               the variable str. You should look up str in the
    %               vocabulary list (vocabList). If a match exists, you
    %               should add the index of the word to the word_indices
    %               vector. Concretely, if str = 'action', then you should
    %               look up the vocabulary list to find where in vocabList
    %               'action' appears. For example, if vocabList{18} =
    %               'action', then, you should add 18 to the word_indices 
    %               vector (e.g., word_indices = [word_indices ; 18]; ).
    % 
    % Note: vocabList{idx} returns a the word with index idx in the
    %       vocabulary list.
    % 
    % Note: You can use strcmp(str1, str2) to compare two strings (str1 and
    %       str2). It will return 1 only if the two strings are equivalent.
    %

    for i = 1:length(vocabList)
      if strcmp(str, vocabList{i})
        word_indices = [word_indices; i];
      endif
    endfor
